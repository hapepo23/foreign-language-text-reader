## About FLTR

FLTR (Foreign Language Text Reader) helps you do both extensive and intensive reading as part of your foreign language acquisition in an easy and pleasant way.

While reading, you look up unknown words in web dictionaries (online) or locally installed dictionary applications, save vocabulary terms with translations, and track your learning progress. Each term has a learning status (1/"Unknown" to 5/"Known", plus "Ignored" and "Well Known") with associated colors.
